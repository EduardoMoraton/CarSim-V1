Evolutionary Algorithms with Pygame and AWS DeepRacer Maps
Welcome to this micro project!

Overview
This project explores the implementation of evolutionary algorithms using Pygame and AWS DeepRacer maps. The main goal is to observe how evolutionary algorithms navigate through the circuit in an efficient manner. Pygame provides the graphical interface for visualization, while AWS DeepRacer maps serve as the test environment for our algorithm.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:

Python (>= 3.6)
Pygame library
AWS DeepRacer maps (track files)
Features
Evolutionary Algorithm: The core of the project is the implementation of the evolutionary algorithm, which allows the agents to evolve and improve their performance over time.

Visualization: Pygame provides a user-friendly graphical interface to visualize the evolution of agents on the DeepRacer maps.

AWS DeepRacer Maps: The project uses official AWS DeepRacer maps to test the agents' navigation abilities in a realistic racing environment.

Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
Obtain the AWS DeepRacer maps (track files) and place them in the appropriate folder.
Run the main script to start the simulation and see how the agents evolve through the track.
How Evolutionary Algorithms Work
Initialization: A population of random agents is generated to start the simulation.

Evaluation: Each agent's performance is measured on the DeepRacer track using a fitness function.

Selection: The best-performing agents are selected based on their fitness scores.

Reproduction: Selected agents are used to create new agents through crossover and mutation.

Next Generation: The new agents replace the old ones, and the process iterates from step 2 until the desired performance is achieved.

Results and Analysis
As the simulation progresses, you will observe how the agents evolve and find more efficient paths through the DeepRacer maps. The evolutionary algorithm should lead to better-performing agents over time, demonstrating the power of optimization through evolution.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the Pygame and AWS DeepRacer communities for providing the tools and resources necessary for this project. Their contributions enable exciting experiments in the field of evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters to see how it affects the agent's behavior. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!

Happy evolution and happy coding!
